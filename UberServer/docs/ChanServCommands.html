        <td>With this command you can set certain modifiers for the anti-spam protection that is used with your channel. 
            "settings" argument must contain 4 multipliers separated by space.
            <ul>
              <li>First modifier is an unsigned integer which defines the "penalty limit" - when penalty points reach this
                  limit, user will get muted.</li>
              <li>Second modifier is an unsigned integer which defines the length (in characters) of a "long message".
                  Long messages are assigned extra penalty points when issued by the user.</li>
              <li>The third modifier is unsigned float value telling how much penalty points should be assigned
                  to normal messages issued by a user. Everytime user says something in the channel, he is assigned
                  this value.</li>
              <li>The fourth modifier is an unsigned float value telling how much extra penalty points should
                  be assigned for long messages (defined by the second modifier).</li>
              <li>The fifth modifier is an unsigned float
                  value telling how much extra penalty points should be assigned for "doubled" messages, that is if user
                  sends message that is same as his previous message, it will get assigned these extra penalty points.</li>
            </ul>

            Each second 1 penalty point is reduced from every user. If number of penalty points reaches
            'penality limit' (defined by first modifier), user is automatically muted for 15 minutes.
            Note that extra penalty points (defined by 4th and 5th modifiers) are added on top of "normal points"
            (defined by 3rd modifier). For example if normal modifier is 1 and extra modifier for long messages is 0.5
            and extra modifier for doubled messages is 0.5, user would get assigned 1.5 penalty points in case
            it sends too long message, and 2.0 in case the message is too long and same as previous message.<br /><br />

            Also note that all float values should use dot (.) as a delimiter, although you can use whole numbers as well.
            This regex describes the exact format of settings string: <br />
            <b><pre>"^\d+ \d+ [0-9]*\.?[0-9]+ [0-9]*\.?[0-9]+ [0-9]*\.?[0-9]+$"</pre></b>
            An example: <br />
            !spamsettings 5 200 1 0.5 0.5 <br />

  <p>Legend:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>[] - optional parameters
  <li>/.../ - this parameter must be ommited if the command is passed to the channel rather than via private message
  <li>{} - sentence (one or more words separated by spaces)
  </ul>

  <p>Notes:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Each command must be prefixed with "!" character (see examples)
  <li>"Access level" tells you the minimum access type that you need to issue the command. Possible access types are (from highest to lowest): Server moderator, Channel founder, Channel operator, Normal user
  <li>Channel founder is the user who has full control over the channel. He can assign channel operators and unregister the channel, as well as act as a channel operator.
  </ul>

  <p>Examples:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>set topic for #main via private message to ChanServ: !topic #main This is a new topic
  <li>disable topic for #main via PM: !topic #main
  <li>add someone to #main's operator list by giving the command in #main: !op someone
  </ul>
